# Evaluation 1

- Decide one dataset to use
- Continue with minutiae Detection for feature extraction
- Do Classification using Clustering

# Evaluation 2

- integrate the code and make a final model.
- Find and evaluate model based on accuracy.


# Updates

- New Feature extractor using SIFT.
- Matching using KNN and thresholding.
- Improvement in accuracy to 90 percent on clean dataset. (as compared to minituae extractor with GMM, with accuracy of around 48 percent)
- Very low false positive rate
